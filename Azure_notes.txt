Storage Key
	- Admin Access

Stored Access Policy
	- Set container access level as 'Private'
	- Create a stored access policy for a container
	- Run the following commands to create a SAS token
		$ctx = (Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName res_grp_name -Name storageaccount_name).Context

		New-AzStorageContainerSASToken -Name "container_name" -Policy "policy_name" -Context $ctx
	
	- Copy the SAS token generated and append with the URL of private file to access it.

Azure Functions
	- PaaS services. Compute service. Serverless service.
	- Compute
		- Provisioned 
			- If you allocate the compute resources (CPU/RAM) before deploying the apps 
			- You will be paying for the compute not for the applications or number of executions.
			- Cost is fixed 			
		- Serverless 
			- No need to pre-allocate the compute resources .
			- Compute resources are created on-demand
			- When a new request comes it loads the code into a VM and executes , when the execution completes it deallocated the machine.
			- Cost is calculated based on the number of executions and duration.		
	- Used to execute a piece of code (function)
	- Every function is performing an atomic operation.
	- Function App is a collection of Azure Functions.
	- A function can be written in C#, JS (NodeJS), PHP, Java, Python, PS etc
	- Functions SDK is created from WebJobs SDK. 
	- Function are executed by a trigger.
		- A trigger is an event or notification sent by user/apps to start the execution of a function.
		- Types of triggers:
			- HttpTrigger
			- QueueTrigger
			- BlobTrigger
			- TimerTrigger
			- EventGridTrigger
			- EventHubTrigger
	- How to develop functions?
		- Azure Portal
		- Visual Studio 2019 with Functions SDK
		- Azure Functions CLI - create, build, run, test and deploy using commands.
		
	- Pricing plans
		- Consumption Plan (Serverless)
			- charged per request and duration
			- 5 minute is the execution duration. Optionally we can change this to max 10 mts
		- App Service Plan
			- Use an existing App Service Plan to run Functions.
			- No additional cost for functions. 
		- Premium Plan
			- High configuration infrastructure used.
			- Advanced networking features.
	- Storage Account is required.
