Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
	- Interface between User and the Azure platform.
	- Resource is an instance of a service type.
	- Resource group
		- Logical container to group mulitple resources in Azure subscription.
		- Group deployment and deletion.
		- Role assignments to a user on a group.
		- Every resource must be part of a resource group. 

Storage Account
	- it offers 4 storage options - Containers(Blob), File Share, Queue, Table.
	- Blob Service:
		- Used to store unstructured data such as audio, video, images, docs , archives etc.
		- Files are called blobs. 
		- Blobs are uploaded into containers - Container is a folder type that can store multiple blobs.
		- Url - https://<storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<blob_name>
		- We can set container access policies - Private, Blob, Container. 
			- Private - not accessible using the URL without access tokens. 
			- Blob - Anonymous access allowed, not access token required.
			- Container - Anonymous access allowed, not access token required. Also provides enumerating blobs feature.
	- File Share
		- Also used to store unstructured data.
		- It is mountable to VM and Desktop machines. Mount the file share as a network drive. 
		- Url - https://<storageaccountname>.file.core.windows.net
		- It use SMB protocol to allow mounting.
	- Storage Queue	(replaced Service Bus Queue)
		- Http Based Queue service
		- Sender application can send messages to queue and receiver application can receive message from the queue.
		- Message remains in the queue max for 7 days untill consumed.
		- One message size is 64Kb
	- Table (replaced CosmosDB)
		- NoSQL key-value pair data storage
		- Used as a database.
		- records stored in Table is called as Entity.
		- Each entity can have max of 255 keys, 3 system defined keys (Partition Key, Row Key, Timestamp)
	- Maximum storage capacity of  storage account is 500TB.
	- Creation parameters:
		 - Storage account name : 3-24 chars allowed, all lowercase, unique, no special chars or space allowed.
		 - Resource Group name
		 - Perormance: Standard or Premium
			- Standard - Magnetic Disk 
			- Premium - SSD storage (for high IOPS)
		 -  Access Tier (default) : Hot or Cool
			- Hot - For frequently accessed file
			- Cool - Infrequently accessed files
			- Archive: Rarely accessed. 
		- Redundancy:
			- LRS - Locally redundant storage
			- ZRS - Zone Redundant Storage
			- GRS - Geo-Redundant Storage
			- RA-GRS - Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage 
			- GZRS - Geo-Zone Redundant Storage
			- RA-GZRS - Read-Access Geo-Zone Redundant Storage
			
		 - Account Kind: Storage V2 (General Purpose v2), Storage (General Purpose V1), Blob Storage
			- Storage V2
				 - Reccommended and new
				 - Supports Standard and Premium
				 - All 4 storage options supported: Blob, File, Queue, Table
				 - Support Hot and Cool Access tiers
				 - Zone support
			- Storage V1
				- Also supports Standard and Premium

Azure CLI
	az login
	az group list -o table
	az storage account create -n sonustorageaccount2021 -g LTITrainingGroup -l westus --sku Standard_LRS --kind BlobStorage --access-tier Hot
	
PowerShell
	Connect-AzAccount
	Get-AzResourceGroup
	
	New-AzStorageAccount -Name "sonustorageaccount2021" -ResourceGroupName LTITrainingGroup  -SkuName Standard_LRS -Location 'East US' -Kind StorageV2 -AccessTier Hot
	
	Remove-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName LTITrainingGroup -Name 'sonustorageaccount2021'


Storage Key
	- Admin Access
	- Regenerate the keys
	- Full permission, no granular permissions
	
Shared Access Signature (SAS)
	- It is an access token used to share the permissions
	- Set validity duration (start and end time )
	- Granular permission (Read/Write/List/Create etc)
	- IP restriction
	- Service level permissions ( Blob/File/Table/Queue)
	
Stored Access Policy
	- Set container access level as 'Private'
	- Create a stored access policy for a container
	- Run the following commands to create a SAS token
		$ctx = (Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName res_grp_name -Name storageaccount_name).Context

		New-AzStorageContainerSASToken -Name "container_name" -Policy "policy_name" -Context $ctx
	
	- Copy the SAS token generated and append with the URL of private file to access it.
